I've always been a nerd, and grew up with a programmer Mom and the original PC in the house.  I could type before I could write cursive and my favorite toys were her spare electronics kits and junk, taking things apart and putting them back together.  My career path has taken me elsewhere over the decades, but the time has come to go from being just a power-user and start getting into content creation and programming now that the platforms have become so blurred and capable.
Winning the Out in Tech scholarship for this program finally made it accessible in the structured way that I needed.  I am inspired by many of the tools I use that are cloud-based and multi-platform, as most of my life the most innovative products were how to sync this with that and relatively limited.
So far the program has been great--I am currently working on my scraper CLI final project, which harvests adoptable dogs from the Mid Atlantic German Shepherd Rescue website to be utilized by the user in a variety of presentations.
